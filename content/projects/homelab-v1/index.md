## Project Overview



## Infrastructure Architecture

The lab consists of multiple servers running different hypervisors and specialized roles:

- **Proxmox VE**: Primary virtualization platform hosting various VMs and LXC containers
- **Proxmox Backup Server**: Dedicated backup solution ensuring data redundancy and disaster recovery
- **Unraid**: Storage server managing large datasets and media collections
- **Docker Hosts**: Containerized applications running across multiple nodes

## Key Features

### Virtualization & Containerization
- Multiple isolated environments for testing and development
- VM templates for quick deployment
- Docker Compose stacks for service orchestration
- Resource allocation and management through Proxmox

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Ansible**: Automated configuration management and deployment
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and version control
- Declarative configurations for reproducible environments

### Networking & Security
- **Tailscale**: Zero-trust mesh VPN for secure remote access
- **Caddy**: Automatic HTTPS with reverse proxy capabilities
- **Crowdsec**: Collaborative security engine with threat detection
- VLANs for network segmentation
- Firewall rules and access control lists

### Services & Applications


### Backup & Disaster Recovery


## Technologies Used

My homelab consists of trusted, and stable opensource technologies

- **Proxmox VE & PBS**: Type-1 hypervisor and integrated backup solution
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container runtime and orchestration
- **Ansible**: Python-based automation and configuration management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning with HashiCorp Configuration Language
- **Tailscale**: WireGuard-based mesh VPN
- **Caddy**: Go-based web server with automatic HTTPS
- **Crowdsec**: Behavioral analysis and collaborative security
- **Unraid**: XFS/BTRFS storage management with parity protection

## Design Philosophy

The homelab follows several key principles:


## Development Journey

Building and maintaining this homelab has been an ongoing learning experience:

1. **Initial Setup**: Started with a single server running basic services, learning virtualization fundamentals
2. **Expansion**: Added specialized hardware for storage, backups, and network infrastructure
3. **Automation**: Transitioned from manual configuration to IaC practices with Ansible and Terraform
4. **Security Hardening**: Implemented proper network segmentation, monitoring, and security tools
5. **Optimization**: Continuous refinement of resource allocation, backup strategies, and service deployment

### Challenges Overcome
- Managing storage across different systems and use cases
- Balancing security with accessibility for family users
- Debugging networking issues across VLANs and VPN tunnels
- Optimizing power consumption vs. performance
- Implementing proper monitoring without alert fatigue

## Lessons Learned

- **Documentation is crucial**: Future-you will thank present-you
- **Start simple, iterate**: Don't over-engineer from the start
- **Backups matter more than uptime**: Test your recovery procedures
- **Networking fundamentals are essential**: Understanding packets, routing, and DNS prevents countless headaches
- **Automation saves time**: Initial investment in IaC pays dividends

## Current Services

The homelab currently hosts:
- Development environments and CI/CD runners
- Media management and streaming services
- File sync and collaboration tools
- Home automation controllers
- Network infrastructure (Pi-hole, Unbound)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma)
- Password management and authentication services

## Future Roadmap

Ongoing and planned improvements:

- **Kubernetes cluster**: Learning container orchestration at scale
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Implementing distributed tracing and log aggregation
- **GPU passthrough**: Adding ML/AI workload capabilities
- **Network upgrade**: 10GbE implementation for storage and VM migration
- **Power efficiency**: Optimizing server power consumption
- **Documentation site**: Creating comprehensive runbooks and architecture diagrams
- **Off-site replication**: Implementing remote backup location

## Metrics & Impact

- **Uptime**: ~99% availability for critical services
- **Cost savings**: ~$50-100/month vs. equivalent cloud services
- **Learning value**: Hands-on experience with 20+ enterprise technologies
- **Users served**: Family members and friends using various services
- **Energy consumption**: ~150-200W average draw with power management
